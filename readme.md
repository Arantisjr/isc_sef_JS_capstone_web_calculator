# JS_CAPSTONE_PROJECT

## JS_WEB_CALCULATOR
 
 The goal of this project is to create a fully functional web-based calculator using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division), handle user input via buttons and keyboard events, and
display results in an intuitive way.


## Core Functionality (Calculation Logic)

The calculator will:
Accept valid numerical expressions (e.g., 12 + 5 - 3).
Handle decimal numbers (3.14 + 2.5).
Ensure correct mathematical precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).
Prevent invalid expressions like multiple consecutive operators (++, --).
Display an error message when

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Enhancement for Better UX)

To improve usability, the calculator will support:
Number Keys (0-9) → Direct input of numbers.
*Operators (+, -, , /, %) → Direct arithmetic input.
Enter Key (↵) → Same as clicking = (Evaluate expression).
Backspace Key (⌫) → Same as clicking ← (Delete last character).
Escape Key (Esc) → Same as clicking C (Clear all input).
